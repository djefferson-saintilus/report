# Web Application Penetration Testing Report
#### Author : *Djefferson Saintilus*

## Executive Summary
The purpose of this penetration test was to assess the security of the http://testphp.vulnweb.com, a web application intentionally vulnerable. The testing was conducted from may 12-18 2023, and focused on identifying vulnerabilities and potential areas of exploitation. This report provides an overview of the findings and recommendations to enhance the application's security.

## Introduction
### Background
The http://testphp.vunweb.com, web application is a galerie platform developed in PHP and MySQL. It allows users to browse and look for image, or artists they like online.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this penetration test were to:
- Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the application.
- Assess the effectiveness of existing security controls.
- Provide recommendations to mitigate the identified risks.

### Methodology
The testing followed a combination of black-box and gray-box approaches. It involved manual assessment, source code review, and the use of various penetration testing tools, including Burp Suite,SQLMAP, and so on.

### Scope
The assessment focused on the http://testphp.vulnweb.com, web application's user interface, and administrative functionalities. The testing did not include the underlying infrastructure or third-party systems.

### Limitations
During the assessment, the team encountered limitations such as limited access to the source code, which affected the ability to perform a comprehensive review.

During the assesment, I am not allowed to test out of the scope, like I was to stay only on the target http://testphp.vulnweb.com

## Findings
### High Severity Findings

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Product Description
- Impact: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the product description, leading to potential session hijacking and user compromise.
- Recommendation: Input validation and output encoding should be implemented to prevent XSS attacks.

#### SQL Injection in User Login
- Impact: The user login functionality is vulnerable to SQL injection, allowing unauthorized access to the application's database.
- Recommendation: Prepared statements or parameterized queries should be used to prevent SQL injection attacks.

### Medium Severity Findings

#### Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Order Processing
- Impact: The application does not enforce proper authorization checks, allowing an attacker to access and modify other users' order information.
- Recommendation: Implement access controls and authorization checks to prevent IDOR attacks.

#### Lack of Session Expiration
- Impact: User sessions do not expire after a period of inactivity, increasing the risk of session hijacking.
- Recommendation: Implement session expiration mechanisms and enforce strong session management practices.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following recommendations are provided to enhance the security of the XYZ web application:

### High Severity Recommendations
- Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
- Adopt a secure password hashing algorithm, such as bcrypt, for user authentication.
- Conduct a thorough code review to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities.

### Medium Severity Recommendations
- Implement proper access controls and authorization checks to prevent IDOR attacks.
- Enforce session expiration mechanisms and employ secure session management practices.
- Regularly update and patch the underlying software components and libraries.

## Conclusion
The penetration test identified critical vulnerabilities, including XSS and SQL injection, which could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and potential compromise of user accounts. The recommendations provided should be promptly implemented to mitigate the identified risks. Ongoing security testing, regular updates, and code reviews are crucial to maintaining a robust and secure web application.
